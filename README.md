#Commune - private stream chats
Commune is a project I made to teach myself Django and Twitter Bootstrap and solve an interesting problem: most streaming sites support chatrooms along with the stream, but they are mostly noisy places. Commune embeds the stream alongside a private chat room to allow managed conversation among friends related to the stream, or multiple chats around a stream for any purpose.
